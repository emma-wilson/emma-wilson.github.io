## Research interests

Previously, I have worked on systematic reviews of experimental neuroscience research. My current interests are:

- community-led open research initiatives
- open-source infrastructures for knowledge dissemination and information retrieval
- critical disability studies perspectives on neuroscience (especially neurodivergent experiences)
