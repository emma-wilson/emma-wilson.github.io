## About me

I am a researcher and recently completed my PhD in Clinical Brain Sciences at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). From 2022-2025, I was Lead of the [Edinburgh Open Research Initiative](https://library.ed.ac.uk/research-support/open-research/reproducibilitea-eori) (EORI).

My current interests comprise community-led open research initiatives, open-source infrastructures for knowledge dissemination and information retrieval, and critical disability studies perspectives on neuroscience, especially neurodivergent experiences.

Outside of work, I am a creative writer, focusing on science fiction, fantasy, and horror.
