## About me

I'm a final year PhD student working with the CAMARADES research group at the University of Edinburgh. I'm supervised by Prof Emily Sena and Prof Peter Kind, and my PhD is funded by the Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain (SIDB). 

My project aims to develop meta-research frameworks for evaluating evidence from studies using animals to model genetic neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Research areas
I use evidence synthesis methods to curate and evaluate biomedical research with the aim of improving methodological rigour, animal welfare, and research transparency. Iâ€™m interested in developing methods to aid evidence synthesis and understanding how we can best support researchers to ensure their work is transparent and reproducible.

I lead the Edinburgh Open Research Initiative, a grassroots organisation aiming to promote and support open research within the University of Edinburgh.
